## Description
_This is a web project to practice using HTML forms and form data and writing JS functions. The initial form asks users to select either a Marvel or Hogwarts Character Quiz From. Upon submit, the user is taken to a new form to answer personal questions. The JS then processes the form data to recommend a character based on those preferences. The character name along with an image is printed to the screen._
